# Extended 'My First Flutter App'

This little app builds upon the app build following the official flutter tutorial found here, https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1/#0

I include Redux to manage state and Firebase to save the favorited startup names remotely. 
The app also includes a google login and settings that are saved with SharedPreferences.
